## 001 semi structured logfile joiner 
This is a rather generic approach to solve the third python assignment of the top ten cybersecurity tools.
I will provide a simplified solution in 002. This should not be taken as blueprint when attempting to solve exam questions,
except if you have understood the code very well. In any case it needs some refactoring as well as better inline comments.
